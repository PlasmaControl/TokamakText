ABSTRACT
This article presents a global reduced model for slab-like microtearing modes (MTMs) in the H-mode pedestal, which reproduces dis-
tinctive features of experimentally observed magnetic ﬂuctuations, such as chirping and discrete frequency bands at noncontiguous
mode numbers. Our model, importantly, includes the global variation of the diamagnetic frequencies, which is necessary to reproducethe experimental observations. The key insight underlying this model is that MTM instability is enabled by the alignment of a rationalsurface with the peak in the proﬁle of the diamagnetic frequency. Conversely, MTMs are strongly stabilized for toroidal mode numbersfor which these quantities are misaligned. This property explains the discrete ﬂuctuation bands in several DIII-D and JET discharges,
which we survey using our reduced model in conjunction with global gyrokinetic simulations. A fast yet accurate reduced model for
MTMs enables rapid interpretation of magnetic ﬂuctuation data from a wide range of experimental conditions to help assess the role ofMTM in the pedestal.

I. INTRODUCTION
Tokamak conﬁnement has greatly improved with the advent of
the H-mode,1an operational regime with a plasma edge region charac-
terized by sharp density and temperature gradients known as the ped-estal. The H-mode pedestal boosts the plasma pressure in a narrow
region at the edge of the plasma. Due to this high edge pressure, the
core plasma, which is typically limited by stiff ion-scale transport, willbe able to attain the high pressures necessary for burning plasmas.While the pedestal results from the strong reduction of transport inthe edge (i.e., a transport barrier),
2there remain microinstabilities that
limit pedestal gradients and account for most of the edge transport. Asa consequence of the importance of the pedestal to plasma conﬁne-ment, it is critical to identify and understand the remaining pedestal
transport mechanisms. This is crucial, for example, to understand and
predict naturally edge-localized modes (ELM)-free scenarios and theproperties of pedestals in unfamiliar parameter regimes like thoseenvisioned for burning plasmas.
Several recent studies
3–9have shown that microtearing modes
(MTMs) are responsible for prominent magnetic ﬂuctuations observedin the pedestal.
10–21Edge modeling predicts that the electron heat dif-
fusivity far surpasses the particle diffusivity:22D=v/C281. This means
that a substantial electron heat transport mechanism must be active.electron temperature gradient (ETG) and MTM are the most likelycandidates, and gyrokinetic simulations suggest that they are bothactive in the pedestal depending on parameters. Nonlinear gyrokineticsimulations have demonstrated that MTM transport is comparable toexperimental expectations in several recent studies.

also presents an inter-ELM proﬁle analysis showing that the electron
temperature gradient saturates, at the same time, as the quasi-coherentﬂuctuations (QCFs), which are shown to be MTMs. The density gradi-ent and the ion temperature and impurity density are un-correlatedwith the QCF. Experimentally, Ref. 4i d e n t i ﬁ e sM T M sa st h es o u r c eo f
observed magnetic ﬂuctuations and ﬁnds that their activity is corre-lated with a reduction in conﬁnement.
Gyrokinetic simulations have been performed to provide more
evidence for the presence of pedestal MTMs and have given a guide-line for future experiments. However, simulations suffer from highsensitivity to initial conditions and experimental data have a degree ofuncertainty. Also, accurate gyrokinetic simulations of the pedestal arecomputationally intensive. Consequently, more-efﬁcient models arehighly desirable.
This paper focuses on the identiﬁcation of MTM in magnetic sig-
nals commonly observed in the pedestal. Recent work
6,7,23,24has
shown that global gyrokinetics (but not local) can reproduce distinc-tive band structures in a magnetic spectrogram. The band structurescan be understood from the fundamental properties of microtearingmodes. Global gyrokinetics encompasses all the physics necessary toreproduce these modes. However, simulation results are exceedingly
sensitive to the details of the equilibrium reconstruction. Proper vali-
dation requires extensive statistical sampling of background proﬁlesand equilibria within error bars, which can be computationallydemanding with global gyrokinetic simulations, especially whenapplied to an extensive set of discharges. The goal of this work is toformulate and test reduced models that can capture these physics inorder to (1) validate the theory more extensively and (2) provide a tool
for the broader community for rapid analysis of magnetic ﬂuctuationdata. These tools may ultimately inform equilibrium reconstruction by
providing a constraint on the range of safety factor within the pedestal.
This article introduces an unstable MTM identiﬁcation scheme,
which is intended to predict thresholds and ﬂuctuations bands (toroi-
dal mode numbers and frequency bands) without resorting to gyroki-
netic simulations. The model is simple and fast enough to be able toapply to a broad experimental database, independent of the device.
We call this method the slab-like mictrotearing mode (SLiM) model.
A set of global gyrokinetic simulations using GENE
25,26will be com-
pared with the results from the SLiM model. The sensitivity of stability
of the MTM due to the change of safety factor proﬁle has been studied
by GENE simulations and SLiM dispersion calculations.
The article has the following structure: Sec. II A, the theoretical
foundation will be described: a reduced global analytical model of the
microtearing mode.23In Secs. II A,B,a n d C,t h em e t h o do fﬁ n d i n g
unstable MTM’s will be introduced. Section IIIwill offer a list of dis-
charges studied by such a method. In Sec. IV, we will discuss the study of
the discharges and possible ways to use the result in equilibrium ﬁtting.
II. THE SLAB-LIKE MTM (SLiM) MODEL
FOR IDENTIFYING MTM FLUCTUATIONS
Recent work by Hassan7displays evidence that there are two
types of MTM in the pedestal. The lower-frequency MTM is well
described by a slab model,23which does not include information about
toroidal geometry. In contrast, the higher-frequency collisionless
MTM is sensitive to details of the magnetic geometry. The work of
this paper focuses on the slab-like MTM only. The study of the colli-sionless MTM is an active area of research and beyond the scope of
this paper.
In this paper, we apply three models to simulating and predicting
slab MTM instability, as outlined in Table I . It goes from complex to
simple from the top to the bottom of the chart. The global linear gyro-
kinetic simulations using GENE
25represent a ﬁrst-principles approach
to this problem. Such simulations consume about 10 000 core hoursper mode (entailing a scan in toroidal mode number) while providing
comprehensive information of the given mode. We also apply the
slab-like MTM (SLiM) model for identifying MTM ﬂuctuations. Thismodel includes two modes of operation: (1) a solver for a global MTM
dispersion relation which will be referred to as SLiM (dispersion) and
(2) a fast mode of operation applying simple heuristics to identifytoroidal mode numbers that may have unstable MTM. This mode of
operation will be referred to as SLiM (alignment). These models are
described in detail in Secs. II A,B,a n d C.
In Subsection II A, we begin with a brief survey of the back-
ground theory. Following this, we describe the slab-like MTM (SLiM)
model for identifying MTM ﬂuctuations in detail.

Ref. 6for several expressions for x/C3ein terms of different radial

The microtearing mode (MTM) is driven by electron tempera-
ture gradientsa
LTe. The original slab mode,27which is of interest here,
also requires the collision frequency to be comparable to x/C3e(other
branches of MTM can be unstable at low collisionality in the pedes-tal
7). Beyond these dominant parameter dependencies, the mode is
also sensitive to g¼Ln

However, a recent discovery6showed that MTM stability in the pedes-
tal is also sensitively dependent on the alignment of rational surfaceswith the peak in x
/C3e. This discovery provides an elegant explanation
for the discrete frequency bands at disparate toroidal mode numbers
that are often observed in magnetic ﬂuctuation data. A simpliﬁed
model23that captures this effect is described in Subsection II B.B. The slab-like MTM (SLiM) model for identifying MTM
fluctuations–global dispersion solver
This phenomenon of “offset stabilization,” wherein MTMs are
stabilized due to misalignment between a rational surface and thepeak of the x
/C3eproﬁle, was clearly elucidated using a global reduced
model of MTM stability by Larakers et al. ,23which is a key compo-
nent of the SLiM model. In the current paper, the term global isused to denote that a model retains variation of background quanti-
ties and solves for a radial eigenmode, in contrast with the local ﬂux
tube approach. This work determined that a global treatment of theproblem was necessary to capture the effect of the rational surface
alignment and identiﬁed the key parameters governing this
phenomenon.
The reduced model solves the dispersion relation deﬁned by the

The formal deﬁnition can be found in the Larakers’ paper.23In addi-
tion, further discussion of MTM stability dependence on l=x/C3can be

simulations.
Figure 3 shows an example of the dependence of the MTM
growth rate as the rational surfaces go away from the x/C3epeak
calculated from SLiM dispersion relation. In this case, the growth ratedrops over 85% as l=x

We can derive a simple criterion for the critical toroidal mode
number below which the phenomenon of offset stabilization mayoccur. The difference of safety factor between two rational surfaces for
toroidal mode number n is dq¼1=n, and then the distance between
rational surfaces can be calculated as dq

C. The slab-like MTM (SLiM) model—alignment mode
Figure 5 presents a faster way to determine the toroidal mode
numbers at which MTMs are potentially unstable based on the theory
presented in Sec. III B. As discussed above, MTMs are most prone to
instability near the peak of the electron diamagnetic frequency x/C3e,
providing a radial stability boundary (two orange vertical lines). The
frequency constraints (two purple horizontal lines) can be calculated
from an analytical model (likely even a local model) or observed from
experimental frequencies extracted from magnetic ﬂuctuation data.
The four lines create a highlighted area (blue rectangle) where the
MTM is likely to become unstable. Since the MTMs are localized
around rational surfaces, if the intersection (blue dot) of the rational
surfaces (red line) and the x/C3efalls inside of the highlighted rectangle,
then the toroidal mode number corresponding to that the rational sur-
face may host an unstable MTM. One ambiguity, which we will dis-
cuss in more detail below, is that the MTM appears to relax the
electron temperature gradient in the vicinity of the rational surface in
some scenarios, thus also decreasing the local x/C3ebelow a standard
(e.g., tanh) proﬁle ﬁt.3,6
To further illustrate the model, we will provide another hypothet-
ical case with a stable rational surface in Fig. 6 (scenarios from actual
experimental discharges will be shown below). Here, the rational sur-face (red vertical line) intersects with x
/C3ecurve outside of the unstable
area, suggesting that there will be no unstable MTM at this rationalsurface.

III. APPLICATIONS TO DISCHARGES
In this section, we apply gyrokinetic simulations and the SLiM
model to a set of discharges in order to (1) demonstrate the validity ofthe physical picture outlined above and (2) discuss the potential appli-
cations of the model such as
•Predicting the toroidal mode numbers of unstable MTMs.
•Determining poloidal mode numbers corresponding to experi-
mentally observed magnetic ﬂuctuations.
•Constraining the safety factor in the pedestal region for equilib-rium reconstruction.
We will survey four discharges: three from DIII-D (162940,
174864, and 174819) and one from JET (78697). Various aspects of
three of these discharges are discussed in separate publications,
6–8
while the analysis of DIII-D shot 174819 is entirely original to this
paper. Collectively, these analyses demonstrate the power of the theo-
retical concepts outlined above for predicting and interpreting mag-
netic ﬂuctuation data and outline some useful applications of the
SLiM model.
A. DIII-D discharge 162940
We ﬁrst review an analysis of DIII-D discharge 162940 described
in Ref. 7.Figure 7 shows the magnetic spectrogram from Mirnov coils
at two time scale. The frequency bands of interest, which arehighlighted with the white outline in the middle plot, are those that are
correlated with the inter-ELM cycle increasing with x
/C3eas the pedestal
gradients recover. Note that the thin, bright bands are not (or weakly)
correlated with the ELM-cycle and correspond to core modes, which
are not of interest here. The global linear gyrokinetic simulations ﬁnd
unstable MTMs at toroidal mode numbers and frequencies in good
agreement with the ﬂuctuation data. Notably, the lowest toroidal
mode number with an unstable MTM is at n¼3w i t haf r e q u e n c y
65 kHz. The corresponding frequency band in the spectrogram can be
identiﬁed as n¼3 in agreement with this result (after factoring in a
possible nonlinear frequency downshift). The global GENE simula-tions ﬁnd additional low-n MTMs at n¼5, 6 in agreement with the
other highlighted band 85–110 kHz. The higher toroidal mode num-
ber MTMs n¼17–28 correspond closely with a high-frequency band
290–500 kHz in the left-most plot. These modes are identiﬁed as
curvature-driven MTM in Ref. 7. In short, global GENE simulations
are capable of reproducing a very distinctive band structure almost
quantitatively with precise agreement on the toroidal mode number of
the lowest frequency band (i.e., the only band for which a toroidal
mode number can be identiﬁed). The linear frequencies are at the high
range of the frequency bands. This is likely due to the nonlinear relaxa-
tion of the temperature gradient around rational surfaces, which was
discussed in detail in Ref. 6. In that reference, it was shown that the
temperature gradient relaxes around the rational surface, which, inturn, decreases the diamagnetic frequency x
/C3e.
The discussion thus far in the present subsection is a review of
the results described in Ref. 7.S u b s e c t i o n III A 1 will describe the new
application of the SLiM model to this discharge.
1. Application of SLiM to DIII-D discharge 162940
The SLiM is limited to the slab MTM active at low toroidal mode
numbers (i.e., it is not applicable to the curvature-driven MTMs at
n¼17–28 described above). Here, we test its effectiveness for this dis-
charge. The SLiM model will be applied for the toroidal mode number
less than 15. Figure 8 shows the rational surfaces ðn;mÞ¼(5, 23),

region considering the top 4% drive (two orange vertical lines) and frequencyboundary 50 to 150 kHz (two purple horizontal lines). The blue dot is the intersec-tion between the x

line). If the dot falls into the blue region, then it is unstable.

nal surface (red vertical line) intersect with x/C3ecurve (black curve) at the blue dot
outside of the unstable area (blue rectangle, deﬁned at Fig. 5 ). This suggests that
n¼1 will not produce an unstable MTM.Physics of Plasmas ARTICLE scitation.org/journal/php

(6, 28) are in the same radial location] along with the x/C3eproﬁles cor-
responding to the relevant toroidal mode numbers. As seen in the ﬁg-ure, the SLiM (alignment) model effectively predicts the three unstablemode numbers identiﬁed in the global linear gyrokinetic simulations.
Figure 9 shows the growth rates and frequency calculated from
the SLiM dispersion solver and global linear GENE simulations. Whilethere are quantitative differences, both models successfully predict theunstable toroidal mode numbers and frequencies identiﬁed in the mag-
netic spectrogram. This suggests that SLiM may be a fast and effective
approach to predicting and interpreting magnetic ﬂuctuations.
The SLiM model successfully predicts the mode number n ¼3, 5,
6 to be unstable. Since the SLiM model is limited to slab-like MTM, itis not applicable to the MTM at toroidal mode number higher than
15. For the high toroidal mode number, the local linear simulations
predicted the broad frequency band of unstable MTM. The local linearsimulations provide similar results as the global linear calculations atn
//C2115 in Fig. 3 andFig. 6 in publication by Hassan.7It is worth not-
ing that the local simulations failed to explain the gap of the low-
frequency bands from 55 to 85 kHz. In other words, the local linear

simulations failed to predict n ¼4 being stable. This mode skipping
phenomenon is caused by the lack of alignment of the rational surfaceswith the x
/C3epeak, which is a global effect.
Figure 10 shows the suggested workﬂow on matching the poten-
tial MTM using the SLiM model and local linear simulations. For the
toroidal mode number less than 15, the MTM is likely to be slab-likewhich can be calculated from SLiM. Since the rational surfaces are not
densely packed for low-mode number cases [ n/C20n
crit,r e c a l l ncritfrom
Eq.(4)], a global effect is needed in order to ﬁnd the corresponding
discrete frequency bands, which SLiM is capable of doing. For the
mode number greater than ncrit, the rational surfaces are so densely
packed that the discrete band will not be observed, plus that MTM
with high mode numbers requires more physics than a slab-like
approximation to determine. Therefore, the local linear simulationswill be a good complement to the SLiM model for matching all the
magnetic frequency bands in the experiment that are likely to be
MTM. Since local gyrokinetic simulations are relatively cheap compu-tationally, this can be done routinely and extensively.
With experience from these cases, we come up with a recipe for
the future calculation of the potential unstable MTM that is far lesscomputationally intensive than the current routine: use the SLiM
model to ﬁnd the unstable MTM at n
/<ncritand then use the local
linear calculation to ﬁnd the unstable MTM at n//C21ncrit.S u c ha
method could greatly reduce analysis time with respect to a global
gyrokinetic analysis.
B. JET discharge 78697
We now turn to JET discharge 78697. The connections between
MTMs and the magnetic ﬂuctuations in this discharge are described inRef.6.Figure 11 shows that global linear GENE simulations reproduce
the ﬂuctuations at n ¼4a n dn ¼8 (red dash lines) observed in themagnetic spectrogram with light blue (n ¼4) and blue (n ¼8) bands.
These results required a slight modiﬁcation of the q proﬁle to ensurealignment of the relevant rational surfaces. The linear simulations pro-duce frequencies that are somewhat higher than those in the ﬂuctua-tion bands. However, global nonlinear simulations exhibit electron
temperature proﬁles that locally ﬂatten in the region surrounding the
rational surface, producing downshifted and broadened frequencybands matching the results of the experiment.
This discharge was studied with the SLiM dispersion solver,
23
which we brieﬂy review here along with global gyrokinetic simulations.

Figure 12 shows the relevant rational surfaces. Note that mode num-
bers (n, m) ¼(4, 11), (8, 22), (12, 33) (red vertical line) align with the
peak of x/C3e(blue curve), while other rational surfaces lie much farther
away.
Figure 13 shows the comparison between the SLiM dispersion
solver and global linear GENE simulations. While there are quantitativedifferences, both models predict unstable MTMs at (n, m) ¼(4, 11), (8,
22), (12, 33) (GENE also predicts a very weakly unstable MTM at
n¼9). Note that the n¼12 mode is not observed in the spectrogram.
Several plausible explanations are discussed in Ref. 6. This scenario pro-
vides additional evidence of the interpretive power of the SLiM model.
C. DIII-D discharge 174864
Analysis of DIII-D discharge 174864 is described in detail in Ref.
8, which traces the frequency of a magnetic ﬂuctuation band through-
out the inter-ELM period and predicts the poloidal mode number of
the ﬂuctuation based on the concepts of the rational surface alignment
described above.
In this discharge, the toroidal mode number is identiﬁed experi-
mentally to be smaller than n¼10 with relative certainty using code
MODESPEC.
29However, the poloidal mode number cannot be directly
extracted from the experimental data. By using the idea of the rational
surface alignment along with the corresponding frequency of x/C3eat the
given rational surface, one can trace the frequency band that is likely to
be MTM and determine the poloidal mode number by matching the
shape of the frequency band predicted by such concepts with experimen-tal observation. As Fig. 14 shows the frequency can be calculated by plot-
ting all rational surfaces with different poloidal numbers (left plot) and
calculating the frequency at each time slice will provide frequency bandswith different poloidal mode numbers (middle plot). By overlaying the
frequency bands predicted by the model with the magnetic spectrogram
(right plot), one can ﬁnd that the poloidal mode number m¼16 matches
the experiment. Therefore, the poloidal mode number for that given fre-
quency is likely to have a poloidal mode number of m¼16.
Figure 15 provides a workﬂow for identifying poloidal mode num-
bers. One can ﬁnd the toroidal mode number from the experimentalﬂuctuation data.
29With proﬁle ﬁts and an equilibrium calculated fromkinetic equilibrium ﬁtting (EFIT),30one can ﬁnd the corresponded fre-
quency with different poloidal mode numbers. If the shape (chirping) ofthe frequency can be matched with the magnetic spectrogram in the
experiment, then that frequency band is likely to have that poloidal
mode number.
D. DIII-D discharge 174819
Finally, we analyze DIII-D discharge 174819, once again demon-
strating the capacity of SLiM to reproduce and interpret the ﬂuctua-
tion data while also outlining potential applications for reﬁningequilibrium reconstructions.
Clearly, the placement of the rational surfaces of low mode num-
bers is highly sensitive to the q proﬁle. For equilibria with low mag-
netic shear, this can result in extreme sensitivity of unstable MTMs tothe q proﬁle. Figure 16 shows that the rational surfaces’ location will
change from the stabilizing location (red vertical line) off the peak of
x
/C3eto the destabilizing position (green vertical line) at the peak by
reduction of the q proﬁle by 2%. Such sensitivity can be exploited for
the q proﬁle constraint at the pedestal region for a potentially more
accurate equilibrium ﬁtting.
Such sensitivity has been a challenge for simulating MTMs using
global gyrokinetics.3,6Sometimes, extensive sensitivity tests are needed
to match the observed ﬂuctuation bands. The SLiM model provides a
unique perspective on the sensitivity to the safety factor. The DIII-Ddischarge 174819 is a good case for showcasing the capabilities of the
SLiM model. As Fig. 17 shows, there are two magnetic frequency
bands that are likely to be MTM, with toroidal mode number of n ¼3
with a frequency of 63 kHz, while the higher band has n ¼5w i t haf r e -
quency of 110 kHz. The toroidal mode numbers are determined by the
code MODESPEC
29using only the experimental data. The expected
frequency of the MTM is x/C3efor the radial location of the eigenmode.
Figure 18 plots the x/C3efor n¼1 and safety factor. The orange
vertical lines roughly denote the radial stability boundary (top 8% of
x/C3e). Since the frequency of peak x/C3e(including the Doppler shift) is
about 22 kHz for n ¼1f r o m Fig. 18 ,t h e nt h ef r e q u e n c yo f x/C3epeak

with the x/C3e, while other rational surfaces (green) are further way.
FIG. 13. This plot shows the comparison of the growth rate (top) and frequency in
the lab frame (bottom) between SLiM dispersion relation calculations (red) and
global linear simulations (blue).23The gray crosses are the stable modes.Physics of Plasmas ARTICLE scitation.org/journal/php

for n¼3a n dn ¼5 is 66 and 110 kHz, respectively. Therefore, com-
paring with experimentally observed frequency of 63 kHz for n ¼3,
and 110 kHz from n ¼5, we can determine that n ¼3a n dn ¼5a r e
likely to be unstable MTM. As shown below, we can also explain andreproduce the absence of the n¼4a n d n¼6ﬂ u c t u a t i o n s .
In order to match the experimental observation ( n¼3, 5), we
can change the q proﬁle so that the desired toroidal mode numbers
will host unstable MTM while keeping the rest stable. As Fig. 19
shows, the values of q with toroidal mode numbers 3 (red), 4 (green),and 5(orange) are the horizontal lines bounded by the radial stabilityboundary. The rational surface will have an unstable MTM if the qproﬁle curve goes through the horizontal line corresponding to thattoroidal mode number. The radial location at which the horizontal
lines intersect with the q proﬁle is the location where the MTM will be
localized. The closer the intersection is to the center dot of the hori-zontal line, the more unstable the MTM will be. The procedure, then,is to modify the q proﬁle (within reasonable uncertainties) so that the
safety factor curve goes through the horizontal lines corresponding to
the desired (experimentally observed) toroidal mode numbers whileavoiding the stable ones. For this discharge, we will need to modify theq proﬁle so that it goes through n ¼3 (orange) and n ¼5 (red) while
avoiding n ¼4 (green). The nominal proﬁle goes through toroidal
mode numbers 4 (green) and 5 (red) while avoiding 3 (orange). Bydownshifting by 2%, these criteria are satisﬁed.

It is worth noting that the stability of the model depends on the
width of the horizontal lines. Similar to Fig. 16 , if the stability bound-
ary were more narrow, as left plot of Fig. 20 , there will be fewer ratio-
nal surfaces that the q proﬁle will go through. On the other hand, right
plot of Fig. 20 shows that a wide radial stability boundary will cause
more rational surfaces to host unstable MTM. Therefore, it is crucial
to know the radial range of stability boundary.
Taking the q proﬁle with 2% downshift, a global linear simulation
gyrokinetic scan of ntorfrom 1 to 7 is performed. In Fig. 21 ,s i m u l a -
tions show the mode numbers 3, 5, 6 are unstable, while n ¼4 is stable,
consistent with the prediction of the SLiM model.
The frequency (red horizontal lines) predicted by the global lin-
ear simulations provides a reasonable match to the experimentalobservation in Fig. 22 with a frequency of 70, 113, and 131 kHz.It is natural to ask why n ¼6 is unstable from the gyrokinetic
simulations while the experiment does not have such a magnetic fre-
quency band. We ﬁnd that even this very distinctive feature of the
spectrogram can be interpreted using the SLiM mode. The questioncan be easily addressed by modifying the q proﬁle in a different man-ner. Figure 23 shows the q proﬁle has been up-shifted by 3%. The
newly modiﬁed q proﬁle can go through n ¼5 at the center of the hor-
izontal line which means the n ¼5 has a rational surface located at the
x
/C3epeak, while the q proﬁle goes through n ¼3a tt h ee d g ei nt h el e f t
plot, which makes n ¼3 unstable. We have observed that the radial
stability boundary becomes more narrow with high toroidal mode
numbers. In this case, it is likely the ratio /C23=x/C3eis farther from the
peak instability range for n¼6t h a n n¼3. Therefore, the n ¼6w i l lb e
stable with 103% of the nominal q proﬁle shown in the right plot.
Taking the 103% of the nominal q proﬁle to do the global linear
gyrokinetic simulations, simulation results shown in Fig. 24 ,w ef o u n d
that the n ¼3, 5 are unstable (red dot), while n ¼4, 6 are stable, which
is now in precise agreement with the ﬂuctuation data. This has beenpredicted by the SLiM using the idea of the rational surface alignment
shown in Fig. 23 .
The frequency (red horizontal lines) predicted by the global lin-
ear simulations using 103% of the nominal q proﬁle provides a better
match to the experimental observation in Fig. 25 with a frequency of
72 and 109 kHz.
There can be a systematic workﬂow to study and modify the pro-
ﬁle as shown in Fig. 26 . One can tell the toroidal mode numbers from
the experiment.
29From the nominal proﬁle, one can plot out the ratio-
nal surfaces similar to Fig. 16 . Modiﬁcations of the q proﬁle can be
determined by changing the q proﬁle so that it goes through the ratio-nal surfaces of desired mode numbers while avoiding the rest (illus-trated in Fig. 23 ) based on the observation of toroidal mode numbers

from experimental data. After changing the q proﬁle, one can use the
SLiM model or simulations to ﬁnd if the desired MTM is stable. One
can also increase in the electron temperature gradient thus increases
the drive to MTM instabilities. Such a procedure could be repeated
until one gets the desired equilibrium. Using such a workﬂow to ﬁnd
the equilibrium provides a very systematic way to conduct sensitivity
tests and provides a stringent constraint that may improve accuracy.
1. Characterizing offset stabilization
In order to characterize the rate of offset stabilization, we com-
pare the GENE and SLiM calculations of the radial offset required tostabilize MTMs. We work from DIII-D discharge 174819 described
immediately above.
Figure 27 shows a set of global linear simulations with the scaling
of the q proﬁle from /C05% to þ5% with 1% increment for toroidal
mode number 3. Changing the safety factor will change the radial loca-
tion of the rational surfaces. Only the rational surfaces that alignclosely with the peak of x
/C3e(blue curve) become unstable (red vertical
lines). For the ones that have unstable MTM, the Ajjamplitude is con-
centrated around the unstable rational surfaces shown in the bottomcontour plot.
The rational surface alignment is a global effect that cannot be
captured from local theory. Figure 28 shows the growth rate and fre-
quency comparison between the global linear simulations (left col-
umn) and local linear simulations at the peak of x
/C3e(right column)

with 95% to 105% of the nominal q proﬁle. The global linear simula-
tions show that MTM’s stability is highly sensitive to the scaling to theq proﬁle while local linear simulations show virtually no response withthis 10% variation of q.
Both the SLiM model and global linear simulations demonstrate
the stability of MTM is highly dependent on the offset

Fig. 29 .T h ev a l u eo f lis determined over the q scaling scan shown in
Fig. 27 with 102%, 102.5%, 103%, 103.5%, and 104% of the nominal q
proﬁle. The SLiM model uses the same proﬁle with a different las theinput parameter. Both SLiM and GENE have a similar sharp drop of
growth rate as the rational surface goes further away from the x/C3e
peak. To convert this parameter to the top percentage of the x/C3efor
the radial stability boundary, it can be translated to top 8%. For the
detail of the conversion, one can check the Appendix at the end of this
article.
A similar q scaling scan with toroidal mode number 6 is also con-
ducted, which is shown in Fig. 30 The n ¼6 has a narrower stability
boundary, with l=x/C3/C240:15, which represents top 2% of the x/C3e.T h e

radial stability boundary of 2% of x/C3epeak. The 103% of the nominal
q proﬁle does not go through the rational surface with n ¼6 and,
therefore, makes n ¼6 stable. This n ¼6 scaling scan further justiﬁes
the choice of using 103% of the nominal q proﬁle in order to match
with the magnetic spectrogram.
IV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
This paper introduces the slab-like MTM (SLiM) model for pre-
dicting and interpreting pedestal magnetic ﬂuctuations. The model is
motivated by the recent discovery that (1) MTMs are responsible for aprominent class of edge magnetic ﬂuctuations and (2) the alignment
of the rational surfaces with the peak in the electron diamagnetic fre-
quency governs the stability of these modes resulting in sensitive selec-tion of unstable toroidal mode numbers. We deﬁne a criterion for thecritical toroidal mode number below which this sensitive n-number
selection can occur: n

where MTM will become stable outside of it ( lis deﬁned at Fig. 4 ).
The SLiM model encompasses two modes of operation: (1) a
reduced model for global slab MTM, which has been shown to qualita-tively reproduce global GENE results by identifying the stabilization of
FIG. 26. The ﬂow chart for equilibrium ﬁtting using the SLiM model: one can calculate the toroidal mode number from MODESPEC, and then frequency and growth rate can
be calculated from nominal equilibrium; if unstable MTM frequencies match with experimental observations, then the proﬁle is good for further usage (such gyrokinetic simula-
tions). Otherwise, one can modify the proﬁle based on the desired rational surfaces which are present until the unstable MTM frequencies matches with the experimental
observation.

toroidal mode numbers, and (2) a heuristic approach for rapidly iden-
tifying stable toroidal mode numbers based on the location of their
rational surfaces (the offset stabilization illustrated in Fig. 5 ). In combi-
nation with sparse application of global gyrokinetic simulations andlocal gyrokinetic simulations for curvature-driven MTM, this provides
a rigorous yet efﬁcient approach for predicting and interpreting edge
magnetic ﬂuctuations.
The major applications as SLiM so far are
•Matching the frequency with an experiment using SLiM and
complemented with local linear simulations for high mode num-
ber MTM.
•Determining the poloidal mode numbers of unstable MTM’s.
•Adapting the equilibrium by constraining the safety factor on thepedestal.
We have surveyed four discharges for which the concept of offset
stabilization was successfully applied to magnetic spectrograms. The
growing number of such analyses demonstrates the explanatory power
of the concept of offset stabilization. Three of these studies have been
described in previous publications. We review these and, in some
cases, extend the analysis. We also present a new analysis of DIII-Ddischarge 174819. For this discharge, there are two frequency bands
which can be experimentally identiﬁed as n¼3, 5. Using the SLiM
model to guide minor modiﬁcations to the q proﬁle, we can precisely
reproduce these mode numbers and frequencies with global linear
gyrokinetic simulations. Perhaps, surprisingly, we can even construct a
scenario wherein the n¼3 mode is unstable while n¼6 is stable
(despite the fact that they share the same rational surface).
Additionally, we characterize the rate of stabilization with offset
distance (distance between a rational surface and the peak). Moreover,
we demonstrate that this is an intrinsically global effect that cannot be
captured by a local ﬂux tube approach.
The SLiM model performs well across different Tokamak devices.
The rational surfaces located at the peak of x
/C3;ewith an integer multi-
ple of its mode numbers explained the discrete band of the spectro-
gram. Under such an approach, simulations’ high sensitivity of the
magnetic proﬁle has been explained. The SLiM model will provide
information on the potential instability that was observed experimen-
tally. By utilizing SLiM, one can obtain more information regarding
the safety factor in the pedestal region which provides a route to veryprecise equilibrium reconstructions of the pedestal.
Future work (ongoing) will entail a more extensive survey of
magnetic ﬂuctuations on DIII-D using the SLiM model.

kk. Due to magnetic shear, kkhas spatial dependence, and thus, the
transport coefﬁcients have a spatial structure with characteristic
length scale xr¼x=k0
kve. Due to the fact that electrons become adi-
abatic at large kk, these functions decay to zero for large kk.
Larakers et al. (2020)24computes a variety of forms for these
transport coefﬁcients. We have applied the rational form computed
using the full collision operator and including Zeff, the full deﬁnition
is found in Appendix B of Larakers et al. (2020).24This description
of the conductivity provides electron response across the full fre-
quency range and spatial range.
The basic form of conductivity describes the essential physics
of the MTM. The coefﬁcient x2
pe=2px/C23is numerically large in the
pedestal, and for the electromagnetic equations to be balanced, the
zeroth-order dispersion relation becomes r¼0. This indicates that
mode will have a real frequency x/C25x/C3nþx/C3T, and the growth
rate will be set by a phase difference in the L11and L12response.
This phase difference is equivalent to the time-dependent thermal
force described in Hassam (1980).31
The spatial dependence of the diamagnetic frequencies is seen
to be important when the characteristic length scale of variation is
of order to the spatial width of the localized transport coefﬁcients.
Letx/C3be the length scale of variation of the diamagnetic frequen-
cies and, xr¼x^sR
k?ve. For r¼x/C3=xr/C281, the local value of x/C3nand
x/C3Tis all that is important. For r/C241, the spatial structure of the
x/C3nand x/C3Tcan affect the mode we expect strong offset
stabilization.
2. Definitions of variable
It is important to show the conversion of l=x/C3describes the
spread of x/C3eby ﬁtting the x/C3ewith Gaussian function,
x/C3e¼x0/C1e/C0x2=x2
/C3. In other word, x/C3¼ﬃﬃﬃ

rwhere ris the stan-
dard deviation of Gaussian distribution. At x¼l;x/C3e
¼x0/C1e/C0l2=x2
/C3, it can be converted to top ð1/C0e/C0ðl=x/C3Þ2Þ/C1100% of
thex/C3e. However, such calculation is just an estimation since the
x/C3eis not a perfect Gaussian distribution function.
3. Details on simulations
One can check the details of the simulations on the paper of
the DIII-D discharge 162940 by Hassan,7and JET discharge 78697
by Hatch.6
For DIII-D discharge 174819, Table II shows the parameters
used for local linear and global linear simulations. A convergence
test has been performed by conducting simulations with twice the
resolution and getting the same numerical result.REFERENCES
